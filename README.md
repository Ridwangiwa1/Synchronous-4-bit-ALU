# Synchronous-4-bit-ALU
Building an ALU that have outputs that print out  results at certain cycles using Non-blocking and shift registers concepts
  
#ALU Functional Specifications 
4-bit ALU
Takes the inputs:
Takes Clock, Reset
4-bit input A
4-bit input B
1-bit c_in (or b_in)
4-bit control signal ctrl
Produces:
1-bit valid
4-bit output C
1-bit c_out (or b_out)
2-bit compare_out

Control Signal Values -->> Operation to be performed 

December 2023: 
I would begin implementing design verification in this module.
